# Pixel Scroll
by Axel Ariel Saravia

This is a simple chrome extension to manage the distance in pixels of the scroll.

This extension only manipulate the scroll of root of the current document.
Any other scroll inside the html document can not be handle.

Some pages prevent scripting insertion, because that the extension can not work in some pages.
